Build analytics-heavy apps that deliver in-app visualizations.


Use Case: B2C Telecom Customer Usage Analytics and Billing Insights
Context:
A telecom provider wants to offer near real-time analytics and usage insights for their 50 million prepaid and postpaid subscribers, while maintaining SLA-based API access for partner apps (e.g., MVNOs, resellers). They also need to run historical analytics to optimize product bundles and detect billing anomalies.

1. Application/API Tier
Data Flow:

Customer self-service apps and third-party MVNO apps access data via API gateways.

APIs enforce SLAs like 99.9% uptime and <100ms latency.

4Vs:

Volume: 200M+ API calls/day from mobile apps and third-party integrations.

Variety: REST APIs, GraphQL, JSON payloads with usage metrics, device type, billing cycles.

Veracity: SLA governance ensures data accuracy and availability across all endpoints.

Value: Enables frictionless customer experiences and partner ecosystem monetization.

2. OLTP Transactional Database (SQL/NoSQL)
Data Flow:

Records SIM activations, recharges, data usage, plan upgrades, real-time billing.

4Vs:

Volume: 10TB of new records generated daily.

Variety: Structured data (customer, product, transactions) and semi-structured logs.

Veracity: Double-write consistency model to avoid recharge anomalies.

Value: Real-time view of customer entitlements; reduces recharge-related complaints by 40%.

3. Snowflake Hybrid Tables for Operational Analytics
Data Flow:

Ingests near real-time usage events directly from Kafka topics via Snowpipe streaming.

Allows telco agents to view live session data and customer complaints within the app.

4Vs:

Volume: Handles 500K+ hybrid table inserts/minute for active sessions.

Variety: Ingests events like tower handovers, call drops, roaming flags.

Veracity: Conflict resolution via deduplication logic using Snowflake Merge.

Value: Improves mean time to resolution (MTTR) for customer issues by 30%.

4. ETL Pipelines into Snowflake
Data Flow:

Daily batch ingest of historical transaction logs, CDRs (Call Detail Records), and CRM data using Fivetran, Matillion.

4Vs:

Volume: 1PB+ of historical data over 5 years ingested and organized into Snowflake time-partitioned tables.

Variety: Billing, usage, location, plan lifecycle, CRM cases.

Veracity: Source-to-target mapping verified via dbt tests.

Value: Enables campaign targeting and churn risk prediction using historical patterns.

5. Snowflake Storage and Query for BI/ML
Data Flow:

Historical and current datasets queried via BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) and ML workloads.

4Vs:

Volume: Supports thousands of concurrent BI queries over terabytes of data.

Variety: SQL queries, ML model inputs, dashboards, executive summaries.

Veracity: Row-level security and masking policies ensure data governance.

Value: Drives $15M/year increase in upsell revenue from personalized bundles.

6. Embedded BI & Streamlit for Insights
Data Flow:

Web apps use Streamlit to show customers their usage trends, offer recommendations, and flag unusual charges.

4Vs:

Volume: 5M+ users interact with dashboards/month.

Variety: Dynamic visualizations, charts, predictive plan suggestions.

Veracity: Directly powered by real-time and historical hybrid tables.

Value: 20% decrease in churn through proactive customer engagement.
